# Flask Learning Repository 🐍🌱

This repository is created while I am **learning Flask step by step**.

I am using this space to practice backend concepts, understand how Flask works internally, and experiment with small examples as I continue learning.

This is a **learning-focused repository**, not a production-level project.

## 📘 What I’m Learning

* Flask fundamentals
* Application structure
* Routing and URL handling
* HTTP methods (GET, POST)
* Templates and rendering HTML
* Basic login page logic
* Core Python concepts used in backend
